# DevOps for Azure API Management - slideless delivery

## Service Description

Many customers are already leveraging Azure DevOps to deploy the APIs they are hosting in Azure API Management. However, automated deployment of the API configuration information including products and inbound and outbound policies stored in API Management has been difficult to accomplish until the recent release of the Azure API Management DevOps Resource Kit (https://github.com/Azure/azure-api-management-devops-resource-kit). The kit provides sample ARM templates and a command-line tool that allows customers to leverage Azure Resource Manager to deploy the configuration associated with the APIs they are hosting in Azure API Management.
